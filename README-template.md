## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 & CSS on VS Code

### What I learned

While this is not my very first project, I have finally learned how to write semantic and cleaner code. I realized that less is more.

As for Github, I'm still figuring it out but I am happy to finally put out work with feeling the need for it to be "complete". 

### Continued development

- Continue to learn and problem solve.
- Joining groups to collab, critique, and network with.
- Continue to figure how to work Github.
